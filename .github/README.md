# File Server in Node JS
## Introduction
As the name suggests this is a fileserver written for Node JS in javascript
## What does this Project cover?
Frontend+Backend for a simple Fileserver, currently only web view supported but I may add support for more platforms in the future
## Features
### Current
1. View Files and Folders with their Info
2. Authentication
3. Download Files
4. Zip Directories and download them
### WIP
Uploading files (this is here because i want to harden the above mentioned first)
### Planned
Streaming Video and Audio instead of downloading it
## Why?
Because i want something to do in my free time
## Contributing
If you feel like contributing something feel free to open a pull request.

Stuff i need help with is mainly

1. Frontend-Design (im just not good at it)
2. Process optimization (always welcomed)
3. Security related (are fine to be made public since this server is only running locally inside my own network and doesnt have access to anything outside of it)
